# Snowflake-Data-Cleaning
This project involed several techniques to clean messy data in `Snowflake`.

## Project Scenario
For a marketing campaign, I have been assigned to find the list of inactive customers (didn't make any transactions in the last 90 days).
Available customers data has several challenges like duplicated customers, missing emails, merged columns, non-standarized phone numbers and wrong data types.
In addition, additional fields need to be calculated.

The task is to reformat and clean the data using SQL functions in `Snowflake` before finding the target list of inactive customers.
